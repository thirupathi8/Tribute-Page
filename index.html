    <h2>History</h2>
    <div class="History">
        Between 1969 and 1974, and again between 1989 and 2002, Nissan produced a high performance version of its
        Nissan Skyline coupe, the Skyline GT-R. This car is proved to be iconic for Nissan, achieving much fame and
        success on the road and in motorsports.
        The GT-R is an entirely new model sharing a little with the Skyline GT-R, including its signature four round
        tail lights, it also features the ATTESA E-TS Pro all-wheel drive system and a twin-turbocharged 6-cylinder
        engine. But the HICAS four-wheel-steering system is removed and the former straight-6 RB26DETT engine is
        replaced with the VR38DETT engine.[5] Carrying on another detail of its predecessor, the chassis code for
        the all-new version is CBA-R35; DBA-R35 and 4BA-R35 for later model years,[6] or R35 for short (where CBA,
        DBA and 4BA stands for the emissions standard prefix). The GT-R also retained its predecessor's nickname,
        Godzilla, originally given by the Australian motoring publication Wheels in 1989 for its R32 generation

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <div class="Overview">
        The GT-R is powered by the VR38DETT engine, a 3.8L V6 with a hybrid wet/dry-sump pressurized lubrication system
        and plasma-sprayed cylinder bores. Hand-built by "Takumi Craftsmen," each engine takes 8.3 hours to assemble.
        The output has evolved from 473 hp in 2007 to 562 hp in the current 4BA–R35 model. The car features the ATTESA
        E-TS Pro all-wheel-drive system, unique BorgWarner dual-clutch transmission, and three drive modes. The Premium
        Midship platform combines steel, carbon fiber, and die-cast aluminum for a 54:46 front-to-rear weight
        distribution. An active suspension system, Bilstein electronic adaptive dampers, and 20-inch forged alloy wheels
        enhance performance. The exterior design, influenced by Japanese culture, incorporates "aero blade" front
        fenders and a Gundam-inspired aesthetic. Inside, the hand-stitched leather interior, carbon fiber accents, and
        multifunction display designed by Polyphony Digital contribute to a refined driving experience. With a drag
        coefficient of 0.26–0.27, the GT-R remains a standout in the realm of production sports cars.
